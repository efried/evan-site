{-| The possible states for a check suite or run conclusion.

  - ActionRequired - The check suite or run requires action.
  - TimedOut - The check suite or run has timed out.
  - Cancelled - The check suite or run has been cancelled.
  - Failure - The check suite or run has failed.
  - Success - The check suite or run has succeeded.
  - Neutral - The check suite or run was neutral.
  - Skipped - The check suite or run was skipped.
  - StartupFailure - The check suite or run has failed at startup.
  - Stale - The check suite or run was marked stale by GitHub. Only GitHub can use this conclusion.

{-| Convert from a String representation to an elm representation enum.
This is the inverse of the Enum `toString` function. So you can call `toString` and then convert back `fromString` safely.

    Swapi.Enum.Episode.NewHope
        |> Swapi.Enum.Episode.toString
        |> Swapi.Enum.Episode.fromString
        == Just NewHope

This can be useful for generating Strings to use for <select> menus to check which item was selected.
